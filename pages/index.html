                <p>
                  We carefully choose our caregivers based on both their professionalism and personal traits. We review
                  the references of every team member to ensure they are trained, caring, and trustworthy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our caregivers have been thoroughly vetted and understand what it means to enter someone's home. We
                  look for truly dedicated people who encourage clients, remain empathetic, and start each day with
                  patience and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This careful selection has made us a trusted partner for families throughout Philadelphia and
                  surrounding counties.
